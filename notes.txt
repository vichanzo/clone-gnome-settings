If your extensions are not from installed packages (not installed through your package manager) then they'll be located in:

~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

You can easily back those up and restore them to the same folder on another PC. As for the settings, you can export them from dconf:

dconf dump /org/gnome/shell/extensions/ > extension-settings.dconf

Although the file extension doesn't matter really, and then on the PC you're restoring them to, use:

dconf load /org/gnome/shell/extensions/ < extension-settings.dconf

FYI, you can actually use:

dconf dump / > all-dconf.dconf

To export all changed settings from the dconf/gsettings storage if you want and then import them on a new install via:

dconf load / < all-dconf.dconf

If you want to, you can open the file and look at the settings first, since it's just a text file, keeping only the settings you want backed up.
